# Methodology of Cinematic Counter-Cartographies

## Introduction
This document outlines the methodology employed in the Cinematic Counter-Cartographies project, which focuses on analyzing Palestinian women's cinema from 2000 to 2025. The project aims to explore the formal refusal in cinematic representations and the socio-political contexts surrounding these films.

## Research Approach
The research approach combines qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the films and their impact. This includes:

1. **Film Analysis**: Detailed examinations of selected films to identify themes, narrative structures, and visual styles that reflect formal refusal.

2. **Contextual Research**: Investigating the historical and cultural contexts in which these films were produced, including the socio-political landscape of Palestine.

3. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources, including film archives, interviews with filmmakers, and academic literature.

4. **Mapping and Visualization**: Utilizing GIS tools to create interactive maps that visualize the geographical distribution of films and checkpoints, enhancing the understanding of spatial narratives in Palestinian cinema.

## Methodological Framework
The methodological framework is grounded in the following principles:

- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Integrating insights from film studies, cultural studies, and geography to enrich the analysis.
  
- **Participatory Research**: Engaging with local communities and filmmakers to ensure that the research reflects diverse perspectives and experiences.

- **Ethical Considerations**: Adhering to ethical guidelines in research, particularly in representing marginalized voices and ensuring informed consent.

## Conclusion
The methodology of the Cinematic Counter-Cartographies project is designed to provide a nuanced understanding of Palestinian women's cinema, emphasizing the importance of context, representation, and spatiality in film analysis. Through this approach, the project aims to contribute to the broader discourse on cinema and resistance.
